# My Customized Spicetify Starry Night Theme

This project is a personalized version of the original starry night theme. Iâ€™ve modified several aspects of the code and style to make it my own. Below is a list of changes and customizations I've implemented:

## Changes and Customizations

- **Star Generation:**
  - **Increased Star Count:** Replaced the original star generation with a loop that creates 500 stars.
  - **Individual Animation Timing:** Each star now has its own random animation delay and duration, producing a unique, unsynchronized fade in/out effect.
  - **Blur Effect:** Applied a subtle blur filter (via CSS) to the stars for a softer, background appearance.

- **Shooting Stars:**
  - **Subtle Appearance:** Modified shooting star styling by reducing opacity and box-shadow spread, making them blend in better as part of the background.
  - **Enhanced Blur:** Added a stronger blur filter (e.g., `blur(2px)`) to the shooting stars so they appear less prominent and more atmospheric.
  - **Dynamic Repositioning:** Shooting stars are reanimated with randomized positions and durations to maintain variety.

- **Interactive Mouse Effect:**
  - **Reactive Stars:** Implemented a mousemove event that slightly moves stars away from the cursor, adding a subtle interactive effect that gives depth to the scene.


## Credits

This project was inspired by the original starry night theme. I have modified and extended it extensively to create a unique, interactive background effect that reflects my personal style.
